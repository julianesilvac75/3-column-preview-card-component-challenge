Although this was a straightforward project, as a newbie, it was quite challenging. I'd never worked with Bootstrap independently before; my only practice involved following instructions from a professor during class. Hence, this project marked my initial encounter with Bootstrap classes, requiring thorough research in the documentation.

The most valuable lesson I gleaned from this project is the skill of conducting effective internet searches. The vast amount of information available on nearly every topic can be overwhelming, making it challenging to identify what suits one's needs best. I am still refining my ability to filter through this wealth of information.

This project represents my first 'significant' project done entirely on my own, and I'm really proud of it. I believe I have acquired valuable knowledge, even though there is still room for improvement.

<h1>Some CSS code I'm proud of</h1>

    body {
	    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
	    font-size: 15px;
	    min-height: 100vh;
	}
	
	.container {
		min-height: 95vh;
	}
	
	.row {
		min-height: 95vh;
	}


So, here's my trick for centering all the content vertically on the page. It's pretty basic, but I scratched my head for about two days figuring this out. The real issue was that I didn't know about the whole `viewport` concept. I was aware I could use the Bootstrap class `align-self-center` to center elements on the grid, but with a min-height of 100%, it just wasn't working. So learning about viewport and how to work it was hands down the coolest thing I learned from this project.

I enjoy working with Bootstrap, so I pretend to keep learning and practicing with this framework. Also, working with properties like `float` and `display` is still a very tricky thing for me, so I feel like I need lots of practice before knowing how to use them comfortably.

-   [Article about CSS Viewport Units](https://alligator.io/css/viewport-units/),  this really helped me understanding this concept.

Although this was a very simple project, for me, as a newbie, it was really challenging. I had never used Bootstrap by myself before, only practice in classes with instructions from a professor, so this was my first experience with Bootstrap classes and it demanded some research on the documentation.

The most important lesson I've taken on this project is how to search properly on the internet. There's a really big amount of information about practically everything, and sometimes it's hard to find what will work best for you. I'm still learning how to filter all this information.

This is my first "big" project all by myself, and I'm really proud of it. I feel like I've learned a lot, even if there's still a lot that could be improved.

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

    body {
	    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
	    font-size: 15px;
	    min-height: 100vh;
	}
	
	.container {
		min-height: 95vh;
	}
	
	.row {
		min-height: 95vh;
	}

So this was my solution for centralizing vertically all the content on the page. It's simple, but I spent about two days thinking about how to do this, and the reason why it was so difficult is that I didn't know the concept of *viewport*. I knew I could use Bootstrap class *align-self-center* to centralize the elements on the grid, but as I was using min-height of 100%, it just wasn't working. So learning about viewport and how to use it certainlly was the most valiable lesson I've taking from this project.

I really like working with Bootstrap, so I pretend to keep learning and practicing with this framework. Also, working with properties like float and display is still a very tricky thing for me, so I feel like I need lots of practice before knowing how to use them comfortably.

-   [Article about CSS Viewport Units](https://alligator.io/css/viewport-units/),  that really helped me understanding this concept.
